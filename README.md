# fft-autoparking-investigation

This project is an investigation the possibility to recognize empty/busy parking places on cars parking.
We suppose to get quite different graphical representation of car parking place (empty and busy) after FFT processing of their images.
That project investigates followng image representation - Grayscale, RGB 24 bits, HSV. Currently, looks like the HSV gives more differences for empty/busy images of parking places after FFT processing.
